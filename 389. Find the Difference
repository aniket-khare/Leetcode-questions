You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"


Solution - 
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        sort(t.begin(),t.end());
        for(int i=0;s.size();i++){
            if(s[i]!=t[i]){
                return t[i];
            }
        }
        return t[t.size()-1];
    }
};
